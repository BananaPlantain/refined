### Changes

* Improve `MacroUtils.eval` by calling `duplicate` before untypechecking
  the tree. ([#262][#262]) Hopefully this fixes nondeterministic compiler
  crashes like [#260][#260].
* Remove "provided" from the dependency on the Scala compiler again.
  This means that you do not need to add a dependency on the compiler if
  you are using refined's macros. ([#269][#269]) See [#256][#256] for more
  details.

### Updates

* Update `refined-pureconfig` to PureConfig 0.6.0.
  Thanks to [Viktor LÃ¶vgren](https://github.com/vlovgr)!
  ([#264][#264])
* Update `refined-scalaz` to Scalaz 7.2.10.
  ([#258][#258], [#267][#267])
