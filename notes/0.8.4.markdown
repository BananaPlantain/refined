* Avoid calling `eval` in refine and infer macros for known `RefType`
  instances. This reduces compilation times by roughly 26% for all
  compile-time refinements with common predicates.

* Avoid calling `eval` in refine macros for a few `Validate` instances.
  In combination with the above change, this can reduce compilation times
  up to 67%. ([#334][#334])
